    <releaseNotes>
      * 1.3.0 - added Transmute() methods for Constructors / Methods / Types allowing quick change of generic type arguments
      * 1.3.0 - added a few new overloads to MethodReflection.From() to allow support for methods returning void
      * 1.2.7 - added collection reflection with helpers for coercing a type to / from IEnumerable
      * 1.2.6 - apparently the binary nuget package didn't have a dll in it
      * 1.2.5 - fixing an issue with the comments produced in source distribution
      * 1.2.4 - after hitting some issues with filesystem path length limitations renaming the folder the Sources package installs to in the hopes of minimizing the filename slizes
      * 1.2.3 - last attempt at packaging didn't work right when multiple projcets included the same package in the solution so rewrote it again to use .pp transformations
      * 1.2.2 - this is a large scale rewrite of the Sources distrbution, making this Sources package safer for use, however no new functionality was added otherwise
      * 1.2.1 - bumping the version to fix some minor things in the soruce package
      * 1.2.0 - added getValue(MemberInfo) / setValue(MemberInfo) methods to MemberReflection
      * 1.2.0 - add ExpressiveReflection.Extensions namespace and exposed most functionality as extension methods on their corresponding types
